# Spring Boot CRUD TODO List

A Spring Boot application for a TODO list is a simple web application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks or items on their task list. 
It serves as a basic example to demonstrate the implementation of CRUD operations using Spring Boot.

Here's a brief description of the components and functionality that included in a Spring Boot TODO app :

<b>Data Model: </b> Todo entity, that represents a task with attributes like id, title, description, dateCreation, dateUpdated and status.

<b>Repository:</b> TodoRepository, that extends CrudRepository Spring Data repository.

<b>Service Layer:</b> TodokService, that acts as an intermediary between the repository and the controller.

<b>Controller:</b> TodoController, that handles HTTP requests and maps them to appropriate methods. The controller methods will call the corresponding service methods to perform the CRUD operations on tasks.
